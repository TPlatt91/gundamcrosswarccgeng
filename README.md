Errors:
* Collectors Number way too large, too wide Font

Problems:


Missing Features:
* Unit ATK/DEF have Unit Colors
* Warship Circles lack text
* Flavortext has variant of card-color (much lighter / card colored dropshadow)



Alternate Styles:
* Units exist with *mid* and *max* line styles with no ryme or reason - most noticeable difference: the group of small lines on the left you see on crew cards.
* 3 different Collection/Promo/Rare Style:
	* No-Top-Corner Unit (PR-T001 / PR-U001 to PR-U039) - Identical to normal Unit, but no "top corner"

	* Goldframe Unit (BT06-097-CR / PR-U040) - Note: Colored ATK/DEF text; Golden circles around ATK/DEF; gold lines, bottom and title bar.
	* Goldframe Crew (BT01-148-CR / PR-C007 to PR-C012) - Note: Shares Goldframe Unit's gold lines, bottom and title bar. No Bottom Color field. Quote as *calligraphy*.

	* Transparent-Frame Unit (BT06-077) - Note: White ATK/DEF strength text

==========================================================
Resolved: 
* Card Layouts v2
* Set Name needs to start *more left* (Warship-style on non circled, at the ATK circle for Units/Pilot/Crew)
* Illustrator at right edge, above Size/type marker, Top to bottom, Aligned at Bottom corner, Black text, white aurora
* Event: only single textbox center formated
* Crew: single textbox center formated on single color crew
* Crew: rule line on multicolor Crew
* Pilots & Armament with Tertiary Rule 
* Promo Warship PR-W001 uses normal Warship Style
* Added missing Red Token & Green Bridge Abilities
* 0 cost icon with 0
* Swapping card type after swapping to multicolor throws an error.
